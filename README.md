# NFT-Floor-Price-Updater
Updates floor price of currently held NFTs. FLoor prices of collections can be retrieved without an API key, however I hold many assets that are individually priced wihtiin a collection and the only way to retrieve their 'floor prices' is to look at their current listings. The API key will be used to retrieve these individually priced assets' listings.

These retrieved prices are then reflected on a google sheet used to log my current NFT holdings and past trades.
